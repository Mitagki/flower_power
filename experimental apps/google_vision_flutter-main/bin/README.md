Just like the main library, any responses provided by the above commands will be given in the JSON format.  So ideally you will want to use a command line json parser to interpret the results.  The recommended json parser for this purpose is [_jq_](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).  With _jq_ you can process the results of a command as follows:

## Quick start

```sh
# step 1 - setup default default JWT credentials
mkdir -p ~/.vision; cp my_credentials.json ~/.vision/credentials.json

# step 2
vision highlight --features OBJECT_LOCALIZATION --image-file my_source_image.jpg --output-file result.jpg
```

## crop_hints

```sh
vision crop_hints --help
```

```text
Set of crop hints that are used to generate new crops when serving images.

Usage: vision crop_hints [arguments]
-h, --help                                        Print this usage information.
    --image-file=<image file path> (mandatory)    The path to the file that will be processed.
    --aspect-ratios=<aspect ratios>               Comma delimitated list of aspect ratios in floats, representing the ratio of the width to the height of the image. For example, if the desired aspect ratio is 4/3, the corresponding float value should be 1.33333. If not specified, the best possible crop is returned. The number of provided aspect ratios is limited to a maximum of 16; any aspect ratios provided after the 16th are ignored.
